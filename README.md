📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
This project is a part of my two-month Data Analytics course, where I focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The aim of the project is to understand the underlying patterns in the dataset, clean and prepare the data, visualize relationships, and draw meaningful insights from it.

📁 Dataset

 This dataset contains job postings from Glassdoor.com from 2017-2018. This dataset includes features such as 
 job title, salary estimate, job description, rating, company name, location, headquarters, size,
 founded, type of ownership, industry, sector, revenue, competitors compile a list of the most important features in this dataset.
 hourly wage minima and maxima,, avg_salary,, num_comp.

job_id: The unique identifier for the job posting (Numeric)
job_state: The state where the job is located (String)
same_state: A binary indicator of whether the job is in the same state as the person looking at the job (String)
age: The age of the person looking at the job (Numeric)
python_yn: A binary indicator of whether the person looking at the job knows Python (String)
R_yn: A binary indicator of whether the person looking at the job knows R (String)
spark: A binary indicator of whether the person looking at the job knows Spark (String)
aws: A binary indicator of whether the person looking at the job knows AWS (String)
excel: A binary indicator of whether the person looking at the job knows Excel (String)
job_simp: A simplified job title (String)
seniority: The seniority of the job (String)
desc_len: The length of the job description (Numeric)
num_comp: The number of competitors for the job (Numeric) collected over a period of time. It is in CSV format and includes various attributes such as [e.g., date, product, region, revenue, etc.].
